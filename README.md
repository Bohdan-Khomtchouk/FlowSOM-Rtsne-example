FlowSOM example
===============

This repository contains a short example showing how to run FlowSOM clustering on a mass cytometry data set and visualize the results with a t-SNE plot.

R code is in the script [FlowSOM_example.R](FlowSOM_example.R)

The t-SNE plot is saved in the [plots](plots/) folders as [tSNE_plot.pdf](plots/tSNE_plot.pdf)
